4)Workdone-:

*We checked how many bills for dinner and lunch and mapped it in bar plot.

*By using mean function we checked tip with respect to time i.e. dinner and lunch, from this we analyzed more value during dinner.

*By using groupby function we mapped tip value in bar plot.

*Then by using groupby function we check smoker count with Male and female.

*Then we add new column tips.pct and calculate percentage by dividing tip with total bill amount

*Then we analyzed tip percentage with Dinner/lunch time and same displayed with bar plot.
 
*Then we visualize tip with total bill by Scatter plot.

*By using sns.relplot function we analyzed total bill with male and female simultaneously and we plot both together.

*Then We analyze total bill is more during dinner time than lunch time by plotting histogram graph.



5) Conclusion-:

1. Total bill is more during dinner time.
